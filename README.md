# PlotQA: Reasoning over Scientific Plots

<!--
This repository provides the PlotQA dataset which deals with the task of question-answering over a very specific class of images, namely scientific plots such as bar plots, line plots, and dot-line plots. This work is to be presented at <a href="https://wacv20.wacv.net/" target="_blank">WACV 2020</a>.
